                <h3>Chess</h3>
                <p>Playing chess is one of my favorite hobbies ever since I learned the rules and played it. I started playing chess when I was in grade 7. Playing chess helps me to 
                    feel relaxed and trained my mind in cognitive and mental benefits, also enhances my thinking on problem-solving.</p>

                <i class='bx bx-book-reader' ></i>
                <h3>Reading</h3>
                <p>Reading is one of the best hobbies that I can bring to life, I usually done reading for entertainment typically during leisure time before, 
                    but I realize it leads me to the all-round development of your brain and personality. To Kill a Mocking Bird, The Great Gatsby are my all time favorites.</p>

                <i class='bx bx-code-block' ></i>
                <h3>Coding</h3>
                <p>Ever since I start learning about coding, I couldn’t help myself to stop it. I want to become a Web Developer so learning a new programming language helps me not to lose track, 
                    it has become my new hobby to learn and read the documentation of a programming language.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <i class='bx bx-game' ></i>
                <h3>Games</h3>
                <p>Playing online games is fun during leisure time, don't let it take over your life. I am really into playing online games after a long day or having a bad day, it helps me to relieve stress and makes me happy. 
                    It also improved my problem-solving skills and logical thinking.</p>

                <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>Acquiring skills in design is not easy to do, especially in creating concepts and ideas. That’s why I have decided to study and learn about designing a website. 
                    I might start graphic design as a hobby and ends up becoming a profession.</p>

                <h3>Photography</h3>
                <p>Photography isn’t my thing, but taking pictures of a person to store a core memory brought me to make photography a hobby. Capturing different angles and scenery gives me 
                    satisfaction in how beautiful nature is, it helps me to appreciate my life every day.</p>
